CombinationsOfSix <br>
This is a Java program that generates all possible combinations of six numbers from a list of integers stored in a text file, and writes the combinations that meet certain conditions to another text file. The program checks whether the combination meets the following conditions:

There are no more than four even numbers and four odd numbers.
No more than three numbers have the same last digit.
No more than two numbers are contiguous.
Usage <br>
To use this program, simply run the main method in the CombinationsOfSix class. You will be prompted to start the program by pressing any key (except "q" or "Q"). Once the program is running, it will read the list of integers from a file called "numbers.txt" located at "D:/tmp/combinationOfSixProject/numbers.txt", and it will write the combinations that meet the conditions to a file called "combinations.txt" located at "D:/tmp/combinationOfSixProject/combinations.txt".

Note: If you want to use a different input file, you will need to modify the path to the file in the code.
